Testing

My first test was to load this up in Chrome and Edge.  I noticed that the checkout container was a bit wonky and everything lined up horizontaly instead of stacked on Firefix.

For another OS, I didnt have access for Mac, but I did have a Linux box at work.  It used firefox and looked the same as my local firefox aside from the lag from it being on the east coast.

Testing on my phone blew up the headers with all the elements fighting for the same space.  The blogs didnt scale down as desired either and the text was squished to the right side of the screen.  The checkout form input fields scaled down too much and it was hard to check to input data.
