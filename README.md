Adopt-A-Dog is my first website ment to guide users in adopting dogs!  With this UI you can browse dogs you wish to adopt and see blog posts about how best to live that dog life.

I wrote Adopt-A-Dog with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.  It was tested to run on Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
